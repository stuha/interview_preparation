# [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
